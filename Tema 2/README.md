# To-Do List App

A simple Android app built with Jetpack Compose that allows users to manage tasks. Tasks are stored in memory and are not persisted to disk.

## Features

- Add a new task (title + optional description)
- Edit an existing task
- Delete a task
- Mark tasks as completed / not completed
- Real-time UI updates with Jetpack Compose

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Ensure your Gradle dependencies are synced.
3. Use an Android Emulator or connect a physical device.
4. Press the **Run** button in Android Studio.
5. The app will launch and you can start adding, editing, and completing tasks.

## Dependencies

- Jetpack Compose
- Material 3
- AndroidX Lifecycle ViewModel for Compose

## Notes

- The app does **not** persist tasks; all data is lost when the app is closed.
